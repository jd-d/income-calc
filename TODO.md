# TODO

## High Priority (Fixes)

## High Priority (UI/UX)
- [ ] Add inline explanations for how the savings margin is applied in each table.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Provide presets for common freelancer profiles (designer, developer, coach).

## Low Priority
- [ ] Animate summary cards when values update to emphasise changes.
